# leak me

__PROBLEM__

 Can you authenticate to this [service](./auth) and get the flag? Connect with nc 2018shell1.picoctf.com 38315. [Source](./auth.c).

__HINT__

Are all the system calls being used safely?

Some people can have reallllllly long names you know..

__SOLUTION__

Looking at the [Source](./auth.c):


Inorder to get the flag, we need to leak the content of password file. If we look the code carefully we notice that it have an output field `puts(name)`.
If we input a name which is bigger than 256 bytes (sizeof(name)) in size it will give us a password `a_reAllY_s3cuRe_p4s$word_56b977`.

Using the above password we get the flag:
```sh
$ printf "\na_reAllY_s3cuRe_p4s\$word_56b977\n" | nc 2018shell.picoctf.com 57659 | tail -n 1
picoCTF{aLw4y5_Ch3cK_tHe_bUfF3r_s1z3_2b5cbbaa
```

FLAG - `picoCTF{aLw4y5_Ch3cK_tHe_bUfF3r_s1z3_2b5cbbaa}`
