# caesar cipher 1

__PROBLEM__

This is one of the older ciphers in the books, can you decrypt the [message](./ciphertext)? You can find the ciphertext in /problems/caesar-cipher-1_2_73ab1c3e92ea50396ad143ca48039b86 on the shell server.

__HINT__

caesar cipher [tutorial](https://learncryptography.com/classical-encryption/caesar-cipher)

__SOLUTION__

We are given a ciphertext `picoCTF{payzgmuujurjigkygxiovnkxlcgihubb}` that is encoded by simple caesar cipher.

Just go to [this](https://cryptii.com/pipes/caesar-cipher) and put the ciphertext there and make a shift of 5 and BOOM you'll have the flag.
