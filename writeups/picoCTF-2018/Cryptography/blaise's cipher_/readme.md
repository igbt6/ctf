# blaise's cipher

__PROBLEM__

My buddy Blaise told me he learned about this cool cipher invented by a guy also named Blaise! Can you figure out what it says? Connect with nc 2018shell1.picoctf.com 59396.

__HINT__

There are tools that make this easy.

This cipher was NOT invented by Pascal

__SOLUTION__
Just google the name `blaise's cipher` which shows us that it a `Blaise de Vigen√®re cipher`.
Again using an [online decoder](https://www.guballa.de/vigenere-solver) we put in all the content and get the flag.

FLAG - `picoCTF{v1gn3r3_c1ph3rs_ar3n7_bad_095baccc}`
