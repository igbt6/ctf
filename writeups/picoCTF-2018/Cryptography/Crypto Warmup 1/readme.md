# Crypto Warmup 1

__PROBLEM__

Crpyto can often be done by hand, here's a message you got from a friend, llkjmlmpadkkc with the key of thisisalilkey. Can you use this [table](./table.txt) to solve it?.

__HINT__

Submit your answer in our competition's flag format. For example, if you answer was 'hello', you would submit 'picoCTF{HELLO}' as the flag.

Please use all caps for the message.

__SOLUTION__

Just use the table to get a key.
Thanks to [ugtan](https://github.com/ugtan) for doing the table thing :)

FLAG - `picoCTF{SECRETMESSAGE}`
