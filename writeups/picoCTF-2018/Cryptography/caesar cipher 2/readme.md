# caesar cipher 2

__PROBLEM__

Can you help us decrypt this [message](./ciphertext)? We believe it is a form of a caesar cipher. You can find the ciphertext in /problems/caesar-cipher-2_1_ac88f1b12e9dbca252d450d374c4a087 on the shell server.

__HINT__

You'll have figure out the correct alphabet that was used to encrypt the ciphertext from the ascii character set

[ASCII Table](https://www.asciitable.com/)

__SOLUTION__

Given:
```
e^Xd8I;pX6ZhVGT8^E]:gHT_jHITVG:cITh:XJg:r
```

From hint we know that different ASCII character set was used so just go [here](https://www.dcode.fr/rot-cipher), put the text and hit `DECRYPT` and within seconds you'll get the flag.
