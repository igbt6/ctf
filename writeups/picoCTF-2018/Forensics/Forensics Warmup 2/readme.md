# Forensics Warmup 2

__PROBLEM__

 Hmm for some reason I can't open this [PNG](./flag.png)? Any ideas?

__HINT__

How do operating systems know what kind of file it is? (It's not just the ending!

Make sure to submit the flag as picoCTF{XXXXX}

__SOLUTION__

Just open the file.

FLAG - `picoCTF{extensios_are_a_lie}`
