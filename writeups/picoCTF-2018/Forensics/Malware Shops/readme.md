__PROBLEM__

 There has been some [malware](plot.png) detected, can you help with the analysis? More [info](info.txt) here. Connect with nc 2018shell1.picoctf.com 18874.


__SOLUTION__

Again this was also a manual task. You have to look for the values and give answer to the question.

First question:
> How many attackers created the malware in this dataset?

I was able to brute force the first question:
```
import time
import socket

port = 18874
host = "2018shell1.picoctf.com"


for first_ans in range(0, 20):

    print("Trying", first_ans)

    try:
        sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
    except socket.error as err:
        print("socket creation failed with error %s" % (err))
    sock.connect((host, port))

    ans = str(first_ans) + "\n"
    res = sock.recv(500).decode('utf-8')

    sock.send(ans.encode('utf-8'))
    res = sock.recv(500).decode('utf-8')
    res = res.split('\n')

    print("CHECKING ----------> ", res)

    if res[0] == "Correct!":
        print("DONE!!", first_ans)
        break

    sock.close()

    time.sleep(1.0)
```

The answer was - 5

Second question:

> In the following sample of files from the larger dataset, which file was made by the same attacker who made the file 08da9228? Indicate your answer by entering that file's hash.
>        hash  jmp_count  add_count
> 0  08da9228       23.0       44.0
> 1  8f7580a2       35.0        8.0
> 2  ebaf5ccd        8.0       18.0
> 3  abad7725       12.0       40.0

> 6  ecff45ad       22.0       65.0
> 7  628e79cf       15.0       18.0

> 9  e787f52e       37.0       29.0


Well in this one I just went by the books, took some time to read the plot and found out the answer was `abad7725`.
