# Recovering from the Snap

__PROBLEM__

There used to be a bunch of animals [here](animals.dd), what did Dr. Xernon do to them?

__HINT__

Some files have been deleted from the disk image, but are they really gone?

__SOLUTION__

Again don't thing too much there are tools for this kind of stuff.
I used [Photorec](https://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/PhotoRec) from [testdisk](https://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/TestDisk). This tool is one of the best out there for such kind of things.

Photorec will recover images from you. One of the image will have the flag.

FLAG - `picoCTF{th3_5n4p_happ3n3d}`
