# now you don't

__PROBLEM__

 We heard that there is something hidden in this [picture](nowYouDont.png). Can you find it?

__HINT__

There is an old saying: if you want to hide the treasure, put it in plain sight. Then no one will see it.

Is it really all one shade of red?

__SOLUTION__

So basically here the flag is hidden between different shades of colors.
To simply view it, upload the file [here](https://29a.ch/photo-forensics/#forensic-magnifier) and use the magnifier to see the image.

FLAG - `picoCTF{n0w_y0u_533_m3}`
