# No Login

__PROBLEM__

Looks like someone started making a website but never got around to making a login, but I heard there was a flag if you were the admin. http://2018shell1.picoctf.com:52920 ([link](http://2018shell1.picoctf.com:52920))

__HINT__

What is it actually looking for in the cookie?

__SOLUTION__

This time we don't have a form, so no `SQLi` meaning all we have to do is play with requests and cookies.
Hit the Big green `FLAG` button and nothing will happen :wink: but then if you'll look at the `HEADER` you'll see same thing as [`LOGON`](../Logon/readme.md) that cookie have a `admin=False` value just change it to `admin=True` resend the requests and you'll get the flag.

FLAG - `picoCTF{n0l0g0n_n0_pr0bl3m_3184f702}`
