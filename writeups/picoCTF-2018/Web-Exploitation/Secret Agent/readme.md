# Secret Agent

__PROBLEM__

Here's a little website that hasn't fully been finished. But I heard google gets all your info anyway. http://2018shell1.picoctf.com:46162 ([link](http://2018shell1.picoctf.com:46162))

__HINT__

How can your browser pretend to be something else?

__SOLUTION__

Reading the name and then the questions gives you all the hint that you have to change you [user agent](https://www.howtogeek.com/114937/htg-explains-whats-a-browser-user-agent/) to somethings of google so you can get the flag.

Change your user agent to `Googlebot-Image/1.0 - Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; Googlebot/2.1; +http://www.google.com/bot.html)` in the requests header and you'll have the flag.

FLAG - `picoCTF{s3cr3t_ag3nt_m4n_ac87e6a7}`
