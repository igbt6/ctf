# Buttons

__PROBLEM__

There is a website running at http://2018shell1.picoctf.com:21579 ([link](http://2018shell1.picoctf.com:21579)). Try to see if you can push their buttons.

__HINT__

What's different about the two buttons?

__SOLUTION__

If you'll read the hint and then see the difference between those buttons you'll notice that `Button1` is actually a button but `Button2` is a link. Now what's the difference? Read it [here](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/presentation/fc56/05437005a02508b58c06c1295aa1f378463d.pdf). This not only tells you about buttons but HTTP requests and forms.

Now all you have to do is edit the `HEADER` of the `Button2` requests, only difference this time is that isn't of playing with cookies we change the requests [method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods) from `GET` to `POST`. Sending that requests will seek you a response telling

Well done, your flag is: picoCTF{button_button_whose_got_the_button_ed306c10}

FLAG - `picoCTF{button_button_whose_got_the_button_ed306c10}`
