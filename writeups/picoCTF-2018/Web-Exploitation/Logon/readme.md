# Logon

__PROBLEM__

I made a website so now you can log on to! I don't seem to have the admin password. See if you can't get to the flag. http://2018shell1.picoctf.com:57252 ([link](http://2018shell1.picoctf.com:57252))

__HINT__

Hmm it doesn't seem to check anyone's password, except for admins?

How does check the admin's password?

__SOLUTION__

When go onto the website there is a form. Put both username and password as `admins` and then you'll be in but you won't be able to see the flag.

Now if we see the take a look at all the `HEADER` that were sent:

```
GET http://2018shell1.picoctf.com:57252/flag

Connection: keep-alive

```

We see that in the above request it is sending `admin=False` so what if we change it to `True`, just edit those header and re-send the request and BOOM!!

FLAG - `picoCTF{l0g1ns_ar3nt_r34l_2a968c11}`
