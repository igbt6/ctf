# General Warmup 3

__PROBLEM__

What is 0x3D (base 16) in decimal (base 10).

__HINT__

Submit your answer in our competition's flag format. For example, if you answer was '22', you would submit 'picoCTF{22}' as the flag.

__SOLUTION__

Again using python:

```python
>>> 0x3d
>>> 61
```

FLAG - picoCTF{61}
