# General Warmup 1

__PROBLEM__

If I told you your grade was 0x41 in hexadecimal, what would it be in ASCII?

__HINT__

Submit your answer in our competition's flag format. For example, if you answer was 'hello', you would submit 'picoCTF{hello}' as the flag.

__SOLUTION__

This is a basic introduction to ASCII codes. Using python to find it:
```python
chr(0x41)
'A'
```

FLAG - picoCTF{A}
