# General Warmup 2

__PROBLEM__

Can you convert the number 27 (base 10) to binary (base 2)?

__HINT__

Submit your answer in our competition's flag format. For example, if you answer was '11111', you would submit 'picoCTF{11111}' as the flag.

__SOLUTION__

Again using python

```python
bin(27)
`0b11011`
```

FLAG - picoCTF{11011}
